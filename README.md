In courses as Physical Chemistry or Quantum Mechanics, Chemistry and Physics major students learn about solving Schrodingerâ€™s equation for systems of 1 to 3 dimensions. Analytical solutions for these systems are not always easy to obtain, and the traditional computational methods used to get numerical solutions are difficult to implement at the undergraduate level. The students are restricted to the simplest systems and must trust or believe in the solutions displayed in the books. The development of interactive tools to teach Quantum Mechanics using Wolfram Language, and in particular the functionalities NDEigensystem and Manipulate, would offer sophisticated and powerful learning tools to the undergrads. The student would have an active role in the learning process, for example, having the chance to inquire on the effects on the wave functions when the potential energy is changed.   Using Wolfram Language I propose to develop interactive learning tools for quantum systems of chemical interest such as the H2+ molecule, the 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator, and the rigid molecular rotor. This learning tool must be design thinking of the expansion to more complex systems of interest in advanced undergraduate courses like quantum chemistry or molecular spectroscopy.
